# MiningGame-2024
For one of my modules at university I had to create a mining game in C. The player had to be allowed to move around the map, gather materials and have a way to win or lose. This was my submission.

If you would like to play, use "w" "a" "s" "d" to move, "m" to mine ores (?), "e" to pick up items (!) and "i" accesses your inventory. You are (8), (^) are mole hills (walls which you cannot pass) and (S) is the shop where you can purchase or sell items to survive and progress. 

You must obtain 1000 coins in order to win the game and if your energy level drops to 0 you faint and lose.
